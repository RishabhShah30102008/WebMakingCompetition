During this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, there are many needs arising at police agencies around the world. Police foundations are stepping up to help law enforcement in many ways. As police foundations engage with the community to secure funding and provide services that will benefit their departments, foundations act as an important liaison among the community, businesses, and the police agency. Police foundations help departments to achieve their public safety goals and are an avenue to accept both financial and in-kind support from interested donors. Therefore, police foundations are in an ideal spot to provide critical support to a police agency during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
