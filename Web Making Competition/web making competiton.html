Leading by example and inspiring thousands in their path, a few good Indian Samaritans are winning hearts with their efforts. Rising above the pandemic constraints and helping others in need, today the real-life Covid Warriors are playing a pivotal role.

Here's a poem for our Corona Warriors:-<p>
</b>
</font>

<font size = 7 color="lime">

<i>

From day and night<br>
Working hard to fight<br>
For others they live<br>
Risking their own for a bliss<p>
Months after months in the hospital<br>
Away from their closed ones<br>
They live a life captivated<br>
Working for others to survive<p>
Letâ€™s be grateful for them<br>
Grateful for what they do<br>
Thank them magnanimously<br>
Venerate them with full empathy
